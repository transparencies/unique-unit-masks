# unique-unit-masks 

SVG masks for Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition unique units

## How it works

We create a `div` with the unique unit as a background image. Inside this `div` we inject the corresponding SVG with [svg-inject (forked for stability reasons)](https://github.com/transparencies/svg-inject) and give the injected SVG a class of ours. From there on we can style the SVG as it would be inline.

## Usage

Check the [example](./example) folder. You will need a HTTP server to serve the files (e.g. `python -m http.server`).
